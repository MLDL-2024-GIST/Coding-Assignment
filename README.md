# Coding-Assignment
These problems are written to give you a better understanding of soft and hard margins, kernel tricks, and optimization methods. Solve the given problems, write a report, and submit it in 3 pages or less. 
## Problem 1
You need to find a decision boundary that perfectly classifies the given data.  

(1) Visualize the Iris data given in the code, and choose an SVM to visualize the decision boundary that perfectly separates the two.   
(2) Then, use sklearn's SVC library to visualize the decision boundary of a hard margin SVM and represent it as your decision boundary.
